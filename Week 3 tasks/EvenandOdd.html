//The initialisation should declare a variable called "x"
//The Condition should determine whether x is less than or equal to 40
//The Increment should see x increae in value in increments of one

//If the conditions are met, the following should execute
	//Create an if statement
	//If x is equal to zero the following should be printed - x is even
	//else if x id divisible by 2 and equals 0 the following should be printed - x is even
	//else the following should be printed - x is odd
